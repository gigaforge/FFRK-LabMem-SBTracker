# FFRK-LabMem
This is a forkekd version of bover87's LabMem branch, which adds additional integration to trgKai's Soulbreak Tracker/Search companion site.  bover78's original readme can be found below.



This is a slightly modifed version of HughJeffner's [original LabMem bot](https://github.com/HughJeffner/FFRK-LabMem) for FFRK. It is built to run with FFRK JP, with various changes made by mendicant and further modified by bover87. **This version may contain bugs. I will try my best to fix any issues, but my knowledge of coding is extremely limited. If you find bugs and know how to fix them, please feel free to create a fork.**

Full automation for labyrinth dungeons on Android FFRK and Windows using a proxy server and [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb)

![App Screenshot](/docs/img/screenshot_01.png?v=3)

Built using Visual Studio 2022 Community, Installer using Inno Setup 6, pre-compiled binaries provided on the [releases page](https://github.com/bover87/HMB-FFRK-JP-LabMem/releases/)

**Note: button tap locations were calculated as a percentage of a 720 x 1280 screen, this may not work on other screen sizes, more testing needed**

## (Somewhat) Quick Start
*(**Note**: Mumu 3/Windows 11 users, please click [here](#mumu-3-users) for instructions specific to you.)*
1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/bover87/HMB-FFRK-JP-LabMem/releases) and find the lastest release
2. Under 'Assets' dropdown download `FFRK-LabMem-x.x.x-Beta-Installer.exe` file and download, run, and follow the steps. (Or you can manually install by downloading and extracting the .zip file instead)
3. Start Emulator / Connect device to USB
4. Set emulator resolution to 720 (width) × 1280 (height).
5. (Optional) If playing using an emulator, lower the frame rate to 30 unless you use it to play other games or stream/record, to improve performance.
6. Turn on 'Developer Mode' in android settings [see here](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options)
7. Activate USB debugging in developer settings
8. Start application FFRK-LabMem.exe (it has a treasure-chest icon)
9. Press `C` to open the configuration
10. [Update ADB host](#adbconnection) if using emulator
11. Restart the bot when prompted
12. Go back into the configuration, Under proxy settings, enable Auto-configure
13. Restart the bot when prompted
14. Restart your device/emulator when prompted
15. Follow any on-screen instructions to install the certificate
16. (Optional, Windows 10 and earlier) If you want to see Japanese characters, change the font to MS Gothic. More information about displaying Japanese characters is give [here](#japanesetext)
17. Launch FFRK
18. On the title screen (with the blue `START` button) auto-detect screen offsets `Alt+O` ('o' for offsets)
19. Start a lab or enter one in-progress

## Basic Usage
Use the installer or extract all files from the .zip file to a folder

Double-click `FFRK-LabMem.exe` it and it will run in the window.  At any time as it is running you can press `D` to disable, `E` to enable, `Ctrl+X` to exit, and `H` to minimize to system tray.

Press `C` to open configuration options

## Setup
For this to work correctly, the following must be set up:
1. Network proxy settings
2. ADB connection
3. Install trusted CA certificate
4. Screen top and bottom offsets
5. Team 1 must be able to beat anything, even at 10 fatigue

### <a name="proxysetting"></a>Network proxy settings
This varies by device and every network is different.  Typically with android devices you would go into the wifi settings, change proxy to manual then enter the IP address of the windows system running the app for the hostname, 8081 for the proxy port, and the following for the proxy bypass:

`127.0.0.1,lcd-prod.appspot.com,live.chartboost.com,android.clients.google.com,googleapis.com,ssl.sp.mbga-platform.jp,ssl.sp.mbga.jp,app.adjust.io`

> **Tip:** you can press `Ctrl+B` to copy the proxy bypass to the clipboard or use the button in the GUI configuration

> **Tip:** for most android emulators if you can view the device ip address for example `10.0.x.x` you can simply use `10.0.x.2` for the loopback to the host system.

If you are going to use a physical device or an emulator on another system, please make sure to open port 8081 in the firewall to allow incoming connections.  On Windows, it usually prompts you on first run to create the proper firewall rule.

### <a name="adbconnection"></a>Adb connection
This allows the application to interact with the android device. First you'll need to enable developer options in the device settings and enable USB debugging.  There are many tutorials online that cover this.

If you are connecting an acutal device via USB, you may need the proper drivers.  See [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb) -OR- [here](https://adb.clockworkmod.com/)

Connecting to an emulator works over TCP.  You can set up TCP with a physical device as well but this is beyond scope.  Android emulators seem to use different TCP port numbers, you'll have to look this up.  The default host and port number configured in `FFRK-LabMem.exe.config` is `127.0.0.1:7555` which is for running MuMu app player on the local machine.

**Known Emulator host/ports**
| Emulator  | Host/Port       | Other Possible Ports? |
| --------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| MuMu      | 127.0.0.1:7555  |                       |
| Nox (5)   | 127.0.0.1:62001 | 62025,62026,62027     |
| MeMu      | 127.0.0.1:21503 | 21513, 21523 (based on instance id)|
| LDPlayer  | 127.0.0.1:5555  | See [here](https://www.ldplayer.net/apps/adb-debugging-on-pc.html) |

### Install trusted CA certificate
If the proxy root CA certificate isn't installed the bot will copy it to the device and switch to the settings screen and offer guidance on installing it.  The root CA certificate is auto-generated on startup in a file called `rootCert.pfx` with a 10-year lifetime (so you only have to install it once).  Addtionally, the .pfx file contains the private key corresponding to the root CA public key contained in the certificate that is installed on the device.

This certificate is only used to decrypt traffic to URLs used by FFRK to run, all other traffic is tunneled through the proxy with no inspection.

### <a name="japanesetext"></a>Japanese text
*(**Note**: This section is optional. Any font that supports Japanese output, such as MS Mincho which was previously recommended, will work, but I now recommend MS Gothic because it's easier to set up and frankly looks better. This is unnecessary for Windows 11 users as it displays Japanese characters out-of-the-box.)*

The bot now supports Japanese text; however, the default font will not display it correctly. If you want to see Japanese characters, you will need to use a font that supports Japanese characters; my recommendation is MS Gothic. You can do this by clicking the treasure chest icon in the top-left corner of the window (next to the bot's name), clicking `Properties`, and going to the `Font` tab. Once there, select MS Mincho from the list and click `OK`. (If you get an error saying the shortcut cannot be modified, close LabMem, then right-click the shortcut and select `Run as Administrator`, then change the font and it will remember it for future launches.) Alternatively, you can simply change the default font (`Defaults` on the same menu where you select `Fonts`), although this will change every other console-based application to that font.

![Menu Screenshot](/docs/img/properties_01.png?v=3)

If MS Gothic does not appear, you'll need to install it. On Windows 10/11, click `Start`, then `Settings`, then `Personalization`, then `Fonts`. Here, on the right side of the screen, click `Download Fonts for All Languages` and it will be installed. Once installed (this may take a minute or two), MS Gothic will show up in the font list.

### Screen offsets
From version 0.9.10 and higher, screen offsets can be automatically detected using `Alt+O` when on FFRK title screen.

## Configuration
### General program options

All of these settings can be accessed by pressing `C`

### Lab walking behavior
Four different lab config files are provided: Balanced (default), Farm, Full, and Quick

Configuring the lab walker behavior and all the various options is documented [here](./FFRK-LabMem/Config/readme.md)

### Data Logging
Not enabled by default, set `Enable data logging` in general program options.  This will create the `DataLog` folder with the various csv files.  Data file formats can be found [here](./FFRK-LabMem/Data/readme.md)

### Statistics

## Upgrading

### Automatic upgrade (v4.5+)
If you previously installed using the installer .exe, Press `Alt+U` and confirm the download.  The installer should download (to app directory) and automatically run.
If you upgrade a manual install (extract .zip) the automatic upgrade will install the new version in your `My Documents` folder.

### Manual upgrade
Verson codes are in the format (major.minor.patch)

For a minor or patch release copy the main executeable to your install folder (and .pdb file if you want accurate error stack traces).

For a major release copy all files.  You can optionally keep your configuration files (any missing settings will use defaults and any unused settings will be ignored)

Please keep your `rootCert.pfx` file, or you will have to re-install the certificate on the android device

## Mumu 3 Users
If you're using Windows 10 or earlier, it's easiest to simply downgrade Mumu to [1.4.2](https://windows.apkpure.com/mumu-player/download/18615) and turn off Windows Hypervisor (Hyper-V) if it's running. Starting with version 8.4.0+ of LabMem, the bot will automatically detect whether Hyper-V is running (off by default in Windows 10, on by default in Windows 11) and adjust its crash detection and other features accordingly, so **all users can use the same bot version.**

Windows 11 users, however, will need to do some legwork to make the bot work. You'll have to use Mumu 3; older Mumu versions and most other Android emulators don't work in Windows 11 without disabling a host of security settings, and Android Studio, Mumu Nebula, and Bluestacks aren't compatible with the bot. You should follow the instructions [above](#Somewhat-Quick-Start) with the following exceptions:

- You MUST use 8.3.2 or later. Otherwise, the bot will often detect false "crashes" mid-battle and restart.
- You can enable developer mode, but Mumu 3 does NOT support USB debugging. Mumu Pro may support it, but I don't have access to it to test.
- In Windows 11, do NOT disable Hyper-V unless you also plan to disable all the other features that prevent older emus from running. If Hyper-V is not running the bot will not correctly configure its features for newer emulators. More concretely, the service `HV Host Service` must be in the `Running` state to be detected (other states, including `Stopped`, are treated as it being not present, and other Hyper-V services aren't checked).
- **Installing the certificate**: After installing and running the bot, look in its folder for `rootCert.pfx`. Place this file in the `MuMuShared` folder in your Documents folder. Then open your `Files` app in Mumu and click on the certificate to install it.
- After installing the certificate, press `Enter` to advance the bot. When running the bot the first time, it will almost certainly crash. **This is fine**, just restart it and it should activate itself then (press `Enter` again when prompted).
